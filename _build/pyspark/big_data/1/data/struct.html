<h1 id="Structured-Data">Structured Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Structured-Data"> </a></h1><p>Structured data conforms to a data model or schema and is often stored in tabular form. It is used to capture relationships between different entities and is therefore most often stored in a relational database.</p>
<p>Examples of this type of data include banking transactions, invoices, and customer records.</p>
