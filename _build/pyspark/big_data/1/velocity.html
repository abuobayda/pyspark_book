<h1 id="Velocity">Velocity<a class="anchor-link" href="#Velocity"> </a></h1><p>Velocity of data translates into the amount of time it takes for the data to be processed once it enters the enterpriseâ€™s perimeter. Coping with the fast inflow of data requires the enterprise to design highly elastic and available data processing solutions and corresponding data storage capabilities.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how quickly data is increasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New York stock exchange captures 1 TB of data during each trading session.</li>
<li>120 hours of videos are being uploaded to YouTube every minute.</li>
<li>Data generated by modern cars; they have almost 100 sensors to monitor each item from fuel and tire pressure to surrounding obstacles.</li>
<li>200 million emails are sent every minute.</li>
</ul>
