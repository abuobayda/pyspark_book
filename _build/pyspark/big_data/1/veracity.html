<h1 id="Veracity">Veracity<a class="anchor-link" href="#Veracity"> </a></h1><p>Veracity refers to the quality or fidelity of data. Data that enters Big Data environments needs to be assessed for quality, which can lead to data processing activities to resolve invalid data and remove noise. In relation to veracity, data can be part of the signal or noise of a dataset. Noise is data that cannot be converted into information and thus has no value, whereas signals have value and lead to meaningful information.</p>
