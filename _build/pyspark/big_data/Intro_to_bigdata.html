<p>“The basic idea behind the phrase <strong>Big Data</strong> is that everything we do is increasingly leaving a digital trace (or data), which we (and others) can use and analyse. Big Data therefore refers to that data being collected and our ability to make use of it.” Bernard Marr</p>
<p>“Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation. ” Gartner</p>
<p>“Big data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines; it requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management and enhanced shareholder value.” EY</p>
