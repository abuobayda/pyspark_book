# Data Science
Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

The main things that set a data scientist apart from a statistician are the ability to work with big data and experience in machine learning, computing, and algorithm building. Their tools tend to differ too, with data scientist job descriptions more frequently mentioning the ability to use Hadoop, Pig, Spark, R, Python, and Java, among others.

In this book, though we’ll focus on Python. Python is a great language for data science because it has many data science libraries available, and it’s widely supported by specialized software. 

Data science and big data are used almost everywhere in both commercial and noncommercial settings.
