# Data Governance
Having very large volumes of data is not enough to make very good decisions that have a positive impact on the success of a business. It's very important to make sure that only quality data should be collected, preserved, and maintained. The data collection process also goes through evolution as new types of data are required to be collected. During this process, we might break a few interfaces that read from the previous generation of data. Without having a well-defined process and people, handling data becomes a big challenge for all sizes of organization.

To excel in managing data, we should consider the following qualities:
* Good policies and processes
* Accountability
* Formal decision structures
* Enforcement of rules in management
