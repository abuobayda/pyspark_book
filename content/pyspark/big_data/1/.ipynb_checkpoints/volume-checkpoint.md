# Volume
The price for storing data has dropped incredibly over the last 60 years. In 1980, the cost of gigabytes was hundred thousand dollars. Now its merely $0.026Â per GB.

The first attribute of Big Data is volume. Big Data projects tend to imply terabytes to petabytes of information. However, some smaller industries and organizations are likely to deal with mere gigabytes or terabytes of data. 

Typical data sources that are responsible for generating high data volumes can include:
* Online transactions, such as point-of-sale and banking
* Scientific and research experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array telescope
* Sensors, such as GPS sensors, RFIDs, smart meters and telematics
* Social media, such as Facebook and Twitter
