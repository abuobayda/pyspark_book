# Velocity
Velocity of data translates into the amount of time it takes for the data to be processed once it enters the enterpriseâ€™s perimeter. Coping with the fast inflow of data requires the enterprise to design highly elastic and available data processing solutions and corresponding data storage capabilities.

Here are a few examples of how quickly data is increasing:
* The New York stock exchange captures 1 TB of data during each trading session.
* 120 hours of videos are being uploaded to YouTube every minute.
* Data generated by modern cars; they have almost 100 sensors to monitor each item from fuel and tire pressure to surrounding obstacles.
* 200 million emails are sent every minute.
