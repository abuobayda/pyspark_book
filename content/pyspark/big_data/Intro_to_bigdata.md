> The basic idea behind the phrase **Big Data** is that everything we do is increasingly leaving a digital trace (or data), which we (and others) can use and analyse. Big Data therefore refers to that data being collected and our ability to make use of it.- Bernard Marr



> Big dataÂ is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.-Gartner


> Big data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines; it requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management and enhanced shareholder value.-EY
